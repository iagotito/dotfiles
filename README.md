# Iago's Dotfiles

My attempt to create some nice dotfiles to me.

## Instalation

Just run this command:

```bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iagotito/dotfiles/main/install.sh `"
```

__Waring:__ it will override your `~/.zshenv`, `~/.config/zsh/.zshrc` 
and `~/.tmux.conf` files so create a backup before.

## Requisites

These are dotfiles mainly to zsh and tmux, so you need to have them 
installed in order to use it well.se are dotfiles do zsh and tmux,
